## Security ##

Security of the service follows established mechanisms for synchronous queries on the Spine. Systems are required to be registered endpoints and will need to register the appropriate message set for their accredited system. They will have a Spine2 issued certificate and communications are secured over TLS mutual authentication. Thus only authorised external systems will have access to this service.

This will be enforced by checking that:

- the ASID of the sender matches that of the certificate being used to connect.
- the ASID of the sender is included in the list of allowed ASIDs for this interaction.

## Requests ##

All requests are HTTP GET requests.

# Response #

The json response will follow a simple four part structure. Note that these sections are not ordered so may appear in any order.

## Error Handling ##

If there is a problem, e.g. an invalid request parameter, or the prescription record can't be found, the HTTP response will still be 200 but the statusCode within the response will be a value other than '0' and the reason will indicate the nature of the problem. The request is rejected before any attempt is made to retrieve the prescription.

| 1 | Not found | Requested prescription was not found. |
| 2 | No unique prescription | found sibling. |
| 3 | Issue not found | The requested issue (instance) didnâ€™t exist, the prescription detail will still be returned without the issue details. |

| 5 | Unexpected exception | Any problem other than those listed above. |
